# Computer-Organization-and-Architecture
This repository contains work from a course that explores the fundamentals of modern computer architecture. Key topics include the basic architecture of computers, 
the interaction between hardware and software, performance evaluation, and metrics. The course covers instruction set design and computer arithmetic, with a detailed
focus on data path and control unit design for RISC processors. Laboratory work involves designing and implementing a 16-bit RISC CPU using an FPGA development system
and VHDL, providing practical experience in hardware description and digital system design.
